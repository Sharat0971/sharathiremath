        <span>Jan 2023 â€“ Mar 2023</span>
        <p>I worked as an Application Engineer Intern in the R&D Lab of BEL, where I was involved in developing a test setup for pilot oxygen masks using LabView for the UI and Python for backend control logic.</p>
        <p>I contributed to designing a real-time data acquisition interface using NI DAQ and created GUI dashboards for monitoring test sequences. I also worked with RS-485 and I2C protocol-based communication to simulate and verify sensor responses under varying pressure levels and environmental conditions.</p>
        <p>This role enhanced my understanding of embedded control systems, sensor integration, and engineering product testing in a high-reliability domain like aerospace defense.</p>

        <span>Jun 2022 â€“ Sep 2022</span>
        <p>As a Railway Scientist Intern, I worked on FPGA-based real-time monitoring of railway axle boxes using Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors integrated into the bearings.</p>
        <p>I developed and simulated signal processing logic on a Xilinx Spartan FPGA for predictive maintenance. I also contributed to interfacing the FBG sensor data with AI models deployed on embedded systems for early failure detection.</p>
        <p>The project involved vibration analysis, spectral feature extraction, and data transmission over a secure network. It gave me first-hand experience with sensor-to-edge architecture and the deployment of industrial-grade embedded analytics.</p>
