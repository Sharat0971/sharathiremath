        <h3><b>AI Calculation Engine with Custom S-Bus and UVM Verification</b></h3>
        <p>Designed and implemented a scalable AI Calculation Engine, leveraging FP11 floating-point arithmetic. The architecture utilized SUM4 blocks with multiple FPMs and FPAs, culminating in a SUM16 capable of 16 concurrent MAC operations. Developed a fully pipelined design to meet 1ns cycle target and implemented high-bandwidth 352-bit read and 176-bit write buses with arbitration protocols.</p>
        <p>Verification was performed using UVM with custom drivers, monitors, and scoreboards. APB-style control logic enabled advanced features like auto-increment, fetch arbitration, and partial write-back. Tackled challenges like burst synchronization, partial results, and unaligned data handling.</p>

        <h3><b>Advanced Urban Traffic Light Control System Using FPGA</b></h3>
        <p>Enhanced traffic flow efficiency by 20% through dynamic signal phase adjustments using a Finite State Machine to manage dynamic traffic light transitions based on pedestrian and vehicular inputs. Leveraged Nexys A7 FPGA for hardware implementation, with LED indicators for traffic signals and a 7-segment display for pedestrian signals. Achieved a 15% reduction in FPGA resource usage by optimizing Verilog code for logic utilization and timing constraints.</p>
        <p>The system integrates pedestrian walking features and left-turn signal prioritization to ensure efficient intersection navigation. Developed using Verilog and FSMs, the controller dynamically allocates signal phases to maximize throughput and minimize congestion. It sets a new benchmark for urban mobility systems focused on safety, adaptability, and sustainability.</p>
